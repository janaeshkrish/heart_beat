# heart_beat
The heartbeat sensor is based on the principle of photo phlethysmography. It measures the change in volume of blood through any organ of the body which causes a change in the light intensity through that organ (a vascular region). In case of applications where heartÂ pulse rate is to be monitored, the timing of the pulses is more important. The flow of blood volume is decided by the rate of heart pulses and since light is absorbed by blood, the signal pulses are equivalent to the heart beat pulses.
